# Property Manager Email Assistant - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

The Property Manager Email Assistant is a Python-based **daemon service** that automates email communication for property management systems. The service monitors an email inbox, processes incoming messages using an AI agent, generates appropriate responses, and triggers relevant actions based on the email content and agent decisions. This plan focuses on a simplified version suitable for a rapid prototype.

## Technology Stack

### Core Components

1. **Python 3.13+** - Main programming language.
2. **Pydantic** - For data validation and settings management (e.g., email credentials, LLM API keys).

### Email Integration

- **imaplib** & **email** (Python built-in) - For IMAP email access and parsing.
- **smtplib** (Python built-in) - For sending email responses.

### AI/NLP Components

- **Flexible LLM SDK** (e.g., Google Generative AI SDK for Gemini, or other chosen model API) - For email understanding, agentic decision making, and response generation.
- **LangChain** (Recommended) - For AI workflow orchestration, prompt management, agent creation, and tool integration. Alternatively, use the LLM's native function/tool calling capabilities.

### Local Persistence (Optional for PoC)

- **SQLite** (Python built-in `sqlite3`) - For minimal state persistence (e.g., tracking processed email IDs to avoid reprocessing).

### Development & Quality

- **python-dotenv** - For managing secrets like API keys and email credentials.
- **pytest** - For unit testing (as time permits).
- **black, flake8, mypy** - For code quality (use as time permits).

## System Architecture

### Components Overview

1. **Email Monitor Daemon**
    - Periodically connects to the IMAP server to fetch unread emails.
    - Parses email content (sender, subject, body, basic attachments if feasible).
    - Passes new emails to the AI Processing Agent.
    - Marks emails as read or moves them after processing.

2. **AI Processing Agent**
    - Utilizes an LLM (e.g., Gemini) configured as an agent with access to predefined tools.
    - Analyzes email content to understand intent, extract key information, and decide on next steps.
    - Can invoke tools to perform actions like drafting a reply, categorizing the email, or logging information.

3. **Tool Executor & Action Handler**
    - A set of Python functions (tools) that the AI agent can call.
    - Examples: `draft_reply(email_content, query)`, `categorize_email(email_content)`, `log_maintenance_request(details)`.
    - Handles the execution of these tools, which might include sending an email via SMTP.

## Implementation Steps (Focus: Rapid Prototype ~4-6 hours)

### 1. Environment & Configuration (0.5 - 1 hour)

    *   Set up project directory, virtual environment (`venv`).
    *   Install initial dependencies (e.g., `google-generativeai`, `langchain`, `python-dotenv`, `pydantic`).
    *   Create `.env` file for credentials (IMAP, SMTP, LLM API key).
    *   Define Pydantic models for configuration.

### 2. Email Connectivity (1 - 1.5 hours)

    *   Implement IMAP connection to fetch unread emails (`imaplib`).
    *   Parse basic email details (From, Subject, Body) using the `email` library.
    *   Implement basic SMTP functionality to send emails (`smtplib`).
    *   Function to mark emails as read.

### 3. AI Agent & Basic Tools (1.5 - 2.5 hours)

    *   Set up connection to the chosen LLM (e.g., Gemini).
    *   Design a core prompt for the AI agent to triage emails and decide on actions.
    *   Define 1-2 simple tools using LangChain or native LLM function calling (e.g., `draft_reply_tool`, `summarize_email_tool`).
    *   Implement the logic for the agent to process an email and invoke a tool.
    *   The `draft_reply_tool` would use the LLM to generate a response draft.

### 4. Daemon Loop & Logging (0.5 - 1 hour)

    *   Create a main loop for the daemon that:
        *   Checks for new emails periodically.
        *   Processes them through the AI agent.
        *   Handles basic error logging.
    *   (Optional) Basic SQLite integration to track processed email IDs.

## Key Features (Simplified for PoC)

### Email Processing

- Triage of unread emails.
- AI-driven intent understanding and information extraction.
- Marking emails as read/processed.

### Response Generation

- AI-generated draft responses based on email content.
- Ability to send generated responses.

### Action Triggering

- Agent invoking simple, predefined Python functions (tools) based on email analysis.

## Security Considerations (for PoC)

- Securely manage API keys and email credentials using `.env` and `python-dotenv`.
- Be mindful of any sensitive data processed from emails, even in a test environment.

## Testing Strategy (for PoC)

- Manual testing of the end-to-end email processing flow.
- (Optional, if time allows) Basic unit tests for critical functions like email parsing or tool execution.

## Deployment Considerations (for PoC)

- Run as a local Python script/daemon.
- Ensure necessary environment variables are set.

## Future Enhancements

(These can be listed as potential next steps beyond the PoC)

1. Advanced analytics dashboard.
2. Machine learning for response improvement.
3. Integration with additional property management systems.
4. More sophisticated workflow engine and toolset.
5. Robust error handling and retry mechanisms.
6. Handling attachments more comprehensively.

## Success Metrics (for PoC)

1. Successfully fetches and parses unread emails.
2. AI agent correctly understands basic intents for a few sample emails.
3. AI agent successfully invokes at least one tool (e.g., generates a draft reply).
4. Daemon runs continuously and processes new emails as they arrive.

This revised plan aims for a manageable scope for your test assignment, focusing on demonstrating the core AI-assisted email processing loop.
